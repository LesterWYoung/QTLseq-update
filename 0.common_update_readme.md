This branch is to update the "global variables" that are in `0.common/common.fnc`
Updated files will be `./config.txt`, `Bat_make_common.fnc.sh`.
Running `Bat_make_common.fnc.sh` will read user definable variables from `config.txt` and arrange then in a way that the pipeline can use them in `common.fnc`
