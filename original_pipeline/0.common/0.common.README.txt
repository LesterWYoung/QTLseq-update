I changed the name of this directory from `0.common` to `0.pipeline_variables` as I thought it reflected a bit better 
what this directory stores. The problem with doing this is that all the subsequent Bat_ files load the file with the 
variables in it with `../0.common/common.fnc`, so I'll probably change things back again soon. A reason for this 
change here is to learn how to use github and git
