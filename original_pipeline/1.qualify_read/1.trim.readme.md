The `1.trim_and_filter_reads` directory will replace the `1.qualify_reads` directory
In this part of the pathway, the readfiles will be trimmed using trimmomatic and files for each individual will be 
created. A foward and reverese readfile will be made for paired and unpaired reads. We're interested in the foward 
paired (1P) and reverse paired (2P) readfiles.

The pipeline will expect to find readfiles in the mybulk_A and mybulk_B directories and, optionally, the parental 
directory. The mybulk_A and mybulk_B readfiles need to have the following format:

	`readfilename_[0-9]*_R1.fastq.gz` for the foward reads
	`readfilename_[0-9]*_R2.fastq.gz` for the reverse reads

The output of the trimmomatic will be
	`readfilename_[0-9]*_R1P.fastq.gz` for the paired foward reads
	`readfilename_[0-9]*_R2P.fastq.gz` for the paired reverse reads
	`readfilename_[0-9]*_R1U.fastq.gz` for the unpaired foward reads
	`readfilename_[0-9]*_R2U.fastq.gz` for the unpaired reverse reads

*fill in details about trimmomatic options after this*
